## Object Detection

Leveraging the power of YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once version 8), I accurately identified and tracked various objects in both images and videos. From bustling streets in Tashkent to iconic landmarks in New York City, YOLOv8 excelled at detecting diverse objects with remarkable speed and precision.

## Insights and Applications

Through fine-tuning the YOLOv8 model on custom datasets and rigorous testing on both images and videos, I've pushed the boundaries of what's possible in object detection. The insights gained from this project will pave the way for innovative applications in fields like computer vision, urban planning, and beyond.

## Stay Tuned!

Excited to continue exploring the endless possibilities of deep learning and computer vision technologies like YOLOv8. Stay tuned for more updates on my journey into the world of AI and machine learning!
